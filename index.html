                            <p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890, Providence, Rhode Island – March 15, 1937), better known as H. P. Lovecraft, was an American writer who revolutionized the horror, strange fiction, science, fantasy, and fantasy genres. and horror, giving him fantastical elements typical of the fantasy and science fiction genres, being best known for his creation of the Cthulhu Mythos.
                            Lovecraft originated the cycle of stories that were later grouped into the Cthulhu Mythos and the fictional grimoire known as the Necronomicon — attributed in his stories to a strange Arab named Abdul Al Hazred — through which humans in his stories came into contact with each other. the pantheon of entities created by the author. Lovecraft was openly conservative and Anglophile, as can be seen in his poem An American To Mother England, published in January 1916. His literary style employs distinctly British archaisms, vocabulary and spellings—a fact that adds to the atmosphere of his stories, such as the short story The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, which contains references to characters who lived before the independence of the Thirteen Colonies, as well as the trades between the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

                                <h3>Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849)</h3>
                                <p>"...Poe did what no one else had done or could have done before; and it is to him that we owe the modern horror story in its final and final state."</p><br/>
                                <p>Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, novelist, literary critic, and publisher.</p><br/>
                                <p>Poe is considered, along with Jules Verne, one of the forerunners of modern science fiction and fantasy literature. Some of his novels, such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", "The Purloined Letter" and "The Mystery of Marie Roget", are among the first works recognized as detectives, and, according to many, their works mark the beginning of true North American literature.</p><br/>
                                <p>Edgar Allan Poe was born into a Scottish-Irish family, the son of actor David Poe Jr., who abandoned the family in 1810, and actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe, who died of tuberculosis in 1811. After the death of his mother, Poe he was taken in by Francis Allan and her husband John Allan, a successful tobacco merchant from Richmond, who never legally adopted him but gave him his surname (often misspelled "Allen"). After attending Misses Duborg School in London and Manor School in Stoke Newington, Poe returned with the Allan family to Richmond in 1820, and enrolled at the University of Virginia in 1826, which he would attend for only one year. . From this he would be expelled thanks to his adventurous and bohemian style.</p>

                                <h3>Lord Dunsany (1878-1957)</h3>
                                <p>"...Baron Dunsany, whose short stories and plays form an almost unparalleled element in our literature."</p><br/>
                                <p>Edward John Moreton Drax Plunket was born on July 24, 1878 in his family's castle in County Meath, Ireland. After the death of his father, in 1898, who had been a renowned mechanical engineer during his lifetime, he assumed the post of 18th Baron of Dunsany. He was educated at "Eton" at the Sandhursty Military Academy and served in His Majesty's Army in the Boer Wars in southern African territory.</p><br/>
                                <p>Dunsany was also a great fan of chess games (which he was a great champion) having invented the "Dunsany Chess" in 1942 and facing the Cuban GM Capablanca. In addition he enjoyed cricket and tennis.</p><br/>
                                <p>Back in England, he began his great literary production: "The Gods of Pegäna" (1905), "Time and the Gods" (1906) and "A Dreamer's Tales" (1910). His literary work is characterized by the beauty of his writing and his great imagination that creates pantheons and believable worlds, he can be considered one of the fathers of fantastic literature. In 1910 his literary mentor W.B. Yeats encourages him to write plays, plays that became so famous that 5 of his plays were shown simultaneously on Broadway, from his book "Five Plays". When World War I broke out he volunteered to serve in the British Army, but returned wounded in the Dublin Uprising of 1916 and joined the Royal Guard in Flanders.</p>

                                <h3>Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951)</h3>
                                <p>"...Blackwood's masterpieces reach a genuinely classical level, and evoke like no other piece of literature a haunted and convinced sense of the immanence of strange spiritual realms."</p><br/>
                                <p>Algernon Henry Blackwood was born in 1869 in "Shooter's Hill", Kent in England, of noble origins, his mother was the Duchess of Manchester, and his father Sir Stevenson Arthur Blackwood, secretary of the treasury and later administrator of the royal post. Raised in an environment of strict evangelical education at "Wellington College", he soon moved away from his family, changing residence several times and performing various jobs such as: journalist in New York, farmer, hotelier in Canada, he traveled to Germany to study ( where with a class friend he became interested in Hinduism), among other things...</p><br/>
                                <p>In 1899, tired of his adventures, he returned to England at the age of 31 and became interested in the horror genre and literature. His first book of short stories, "The Empty Hose and Other Ghost Stories", was published in 1906, and was an immediate success. The mixture of fantastic and realistic elements, the careful description of the reality in which his stories were set, and the ability to know how to develop the atmosphere, was the key to such success. So much so that the following year he published another book: "The Listener and Other Stories" and in 1908 it was the turn of "John Silence Physician Extraordinary", "The Lost Valley and Other Stories (1910), "The Dance of Death and Other Stories " (1927), "Tales of Uncanny and Supernatural" (1949), and "Tales of Terror and the Unknow" - posthumous 1965 collection, containing some unpublished short stories.</p>

                                <h3>Arthur Machen (1863-1947)</h3>
                                <p>"Of the living creators of cosmic dread raised to its highest artistic exponent, hardly anyone can be named who equals the versatile Arthur Machen..."</p><br/>
                                <p>Arthur Machen was born in Caerlon-on-Usk (now part of Newport), in County Gwent, South Wales on 3 March 1863, later christened Arthur Llewellyn Jones. His father, John Edward Jones (Machen was his mother's maiden name) was an Anglican pastor, vicar of the small church near Llandewin Caerleon. Machen was educated in the rectory. A lonely child, he began to love the calm waters near the Soar Valley, later the grandeur of the Black Mountains to the north, the ancient forest of Wentwood and the more remote valleys of Severn. Though he rarely returned to Gwent as an adult, his work constantly evoked these dark places, often as a prelude to the unbelievable and frightening.</p><br/>
                                <p>Also making a deep impression on the child were the findings of local archaeologists, who at the time were exploring strange pagan sculptures from the time of the Roman occupation of the region. Machen, had found Roman inscriptions and reliefs in his own church at Caerleon, and the child's imagination was captivated by the feeling that the very land he lived on belonged to a tangible stranger - a thought that developed in much of his fiction. The Romano-British god Nodens, whose temple was excavated in Lydney Park near where Machen lived, has become one of his most memorable contributions.</p>

                                <p>A great way to start reading Lovecraft, to understand how his writing works and get used to the author's characteristic open endings.

                                <p>In this edition, we also have other short stories, which introduce Lovecraft's mythology and prepare us for more complex readings by the author. We are getting used to the more archaic writing he used to use.</p>

                                <p>Lovecraft manages to stir our imaginations by describing the main monster of his mythology with some imprecision. A creature so horrible that a mere glance at it can drive us insane. The genius in creating a climate of terror is such that he turned The Call of Cthulhu into one of the most acclaimed works of the genre.</p>
